# Extensible Resource Descriptors

We refer to the definition of XRD's by Oasis here:
http://docs.oasis-open.org/xri/xrd/v1.0/xrd-1.0.html

This library implements the XML format as defined by Oases, as well as the JSON format as defined in Appendix A
of RFC 6415:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6415#appendix-A.

This document format is used by f.e. WebFinger and Web Host Metadata.
